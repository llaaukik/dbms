# SQL - 2

**Design at least 10 SQL queries for selected real time application using SQL DML statements: Insert, select, Update, Delete with operators, functions and set operator.**

 Create and Use Database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS demo_db;
USE demo_db;

2️⃣ Create Employees Table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employees;
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);

3️⃣ Insert New Employees
INSERT INTO employees (emp_name, salary) VALUES ('pratik', 55000);
INSERT INTO employees (emp_name, salary) VALUES ('rhutik', 40000);
INSERT INTO employees (emp_name, salary) VALUES ('om', 48000);


4️⃣ Select All Employees with Salary Greater than 50,000
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;

5️⃣ Select Employees Whose Name Starts with 'A'
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE emp_name LIKE 'A%';

6️⃣ Select Employees Whose Salary is Between 40,000 and 60,000
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 60000;

7️⃣ Update Salary of 'om' by 10% Increase
UPDATE employees SET salary = salary * 1.10 WHERE emp_name = 'om';

8️⃣ Delete Employees Earning Less than 45,000
DELETE FROM employees WHERE salary < 45000;

9️⃣ Use Aggregate Functions (COUNT, AVG, MAX)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_employees,
       AVG(salary) AS average_salary,
       MAX(salary) AS highest_salary
FROM employees;

🔟 Display Names in Uppercase
SELECT emp_id, UPPER(emp_name) AS employee_name, salary FROM employees;

​
1️⃣1️⃣ Use UNION to Combine Employees Above 60k and Employees Starting with 'C'
SELECT emp_name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary > 60000
UNION
SELECT emp_name, salary FROM employees WHERE emp_name LIKE 'C%';

​
1️⃣2️⃣ Use UNION ALL (Keeps Duplicates)
SELECT emp_name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000
UNION ALL
SELECT emp_name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;
